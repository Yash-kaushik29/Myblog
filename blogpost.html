        <p class="font3">Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. If you’ve
            ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe’s author as a
            programmer. The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. The
            more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!
        </p>
        <p class="font3">“Ok, so now I know what programming is, but what’s coding? I’m here to learn how to code. Are
            they the same
            thing?”

            While sometimes used interchangeably, programming and coding actually have different definitions.

            Programming is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
            Coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.
        </p>
        <p class="font3">Computers interpret instructions in a very literal manner, so we have to be very specific in
            how we program them. Think about instructing someone to walk. If you start by telling them, “Put your foot
            in front of yourself,” do they know what a foot is? Or what front means? (and now we understand why it’s
            taken so long to develop bipedal robots…). In coding, that could mean making sure that small things like
            punctuation and spelling are correct. Many tears have been shed over a missing semicolon (;) a symbol that a
            lot of programming languages use to denote the end of a line.</p>
        <p class="font3">As programming becomes a larger part of our lives, it’s vital that everyone has an
            understanding of what programming is and how it can be used. Programming is important to our careers, but it
            also plays a key role in how we participate in politics, how we buy things, and how we stay in touch with
            one another.</p>
        <p class="font3">Learning to code is an exciting journey. Whether your goal is to build a mobile app, search a
            database, or program a robot, coding is a skill that will take you far in life. Just remember — computers
            are tools. While learning to program may initially be frustrating, if you choose to stick with it, you’ll be
            able to make some brilliant things.</p>
